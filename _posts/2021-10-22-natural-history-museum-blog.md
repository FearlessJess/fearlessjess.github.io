title: Thoughts on the Natural History Museum Online Exhibits
---

Take a look at the vitual tour of the [Fantastic Beasts™:The Wonder of Nature Exhibition](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/take-a-virtual-stroll-through-the-exhibition/CwIC5WiUgJ_VJw) at the Museum.

This exhibition takes us through an online exploration of the fascinating world of Fantastic Beasts ™ created by J.K Rowling with exhibits such as the leading character, Magizoologist Newt Scamander™, and the mythical creatures “from roaring dragons to mischievous Nifflers”along with the real-life animals which are equally remarkable and captivating, among others.

This virtual tour is supported by Google Arts & Culture platform with a 360° field of view of each displayed scene within the exhibition, at the bottom left side there’re passages that give introduction to the exhibition as well as the exhibits shown in the current scene.

In my opinion, the presentation approach adopted by this online exhibition truly offers us an intuitive way of viewing and appreciating the display objects in an interactive manner. Viewers can simply move and drag their mouse to change any angle of perception to get a panoramic view of the whole setting! So, not only the exhibiting item itself, but also the environment and ambience surrounding it can be contemplated as a integrated experience.

However, I also have some doubts towards several details represented in this virtual display. First of all, some of the exhibits are blurred quite notably, which I guess is because of copy right issue, but it really affects the viewing experience a lot. Other than that, inside every scene you cannot click on any point on the screen in order to move to another location spot nor can you zoom in to get more viewing angle or clearer details out of the exhibits.
